Access Code Equality
You are attempting to join the Web Club NITK’s exclusive online session. To do so, you need to enter the correct access code.

The correct code is "WECNITK" (without quotes).
The code you entered is given by the string S, which has length 7.

Your task is to verify whether the entered code S matches the correct code.
If it does, print "Welcome to Web Club!". Otherwise, print "Access denied".

## Input Format
The first and the only line of input will contain a string S of length 7, denoting the access code that was entered.

## Output Format
Print the correct output according to the access code S.

Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase - for example the string "AcCeSS DEniEd" will be accepted if the correct answer is "Access denied".

## Constraints
The length of the string S is exactly 7.

S contains only uppercase and lowercase English letters, i.e. the characters 'a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z'.
Sample 1:
## Input
WECNITK
## Output
Welcome to Web Club!
## Explanation:
The access code entered matches the expected one, so you are granted access.

Sample 2:
## Input
WECnitk
## Output
Access denied
## Explanation:
The access code entered does not match the expected one, so you are not granted access. Note that a mismatch in uppercase/lowercase is still considered a mismatch: the code must match exactly.
